This design system, named "Elegant", uses a modern and clean aesthetic with two distinct color schemes: a light mode and a dark mode.

**Color Palette:**

*   **Primary Accent Color:** A vibrant orange (approximately #FFA500) is used for primary buttons, highlights, and important UI elements.
*   **Light Mode:**
    *   Background: White (#FFFFFF) and a light gray (#F5F5F5).
    *   Text: Dark gray or black.
    *   Cards: White with subtle drop shadows.
*   **Dark Mode:**
    *   Background: A dark blue-gray (#1E293B or similar).
    *   Text: White or a very light gray.
    *   Cards: A slightly lighter shade of the background color (#0F172A or similar) with subtle highlights.

**Typography:**

*   A clean, geometric sans-serif font is used for all text. It resembles "Poppins" or "Montserrat".
*   Font weights are used to create hierarchy, with bold and semi-bold for headings and regular for body text.

**Layout:**

*   The main layout consists of a fixed vertical navigation bar on the left and a main content area that scrolls.
*   The navigation bar contains icons and text links. The active link is highlighted with the primary orange color.
*   The main content area has a header with a search bar and a user profile dropdown.
*   Content is organized into cards, which are laid out in a grid or flexbox system.

**UI Components:**

*   **Cards:** The fundamental building block of the layout. They have rounded corners, and in light mode, a subtle box-shadow.
*   **Buttons:** Have rounded corners and are typically filled with the primary orange color for primary actions.
*   **Charts:** The design includes various chart types for data visualization, including bar charts, line charts (often dual-axis), and donut charts.
*   **Tables:** Tables are styled to be clean and readable, with ample padding and alternating row colors for clarity.
*   **Input Fields:** Simple, clean, and unobtrusive, with a border and placeholder text.
*   **Stats/KPIs:** Key performance indicators are displayed prominently in card components, often with a large number, a label, and a percentage change indicator.

**Overall Impression:**

The design is professional, data-oriented, and user-friendly. The use of whitespace, clear typography, and a consistent color scheme makes the interface easy to navigate and understand. It's suitable for a business intelligence or analytics dashboard application.
